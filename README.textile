h2. "Download CB1.2.5R1_Beta[v2.0]":https://github.com/downloads/K3V1N32/ButtonsPlus/ButtonsPlus.jar

<hr/>

In order for this plugin to work on your server, you must install "Vault":http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/vault/

And an "Economy Plugin":http://dev.bukkit.org (Search for economy) Or use "BOSEconomy":http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/BOSEconomy/

Note: an economy plugin will no longer be "REQUIRED" and neither will Vault after the 1.5.1 update, although it is highly recommended.

I will be adding a couple other ways to pay for the buttons such as either exp, or items, most likely both

h1. About:

This plugin is in a Beta phase meaning there are still some bugs i need to work out, so please help get rid of any bugs in this plugin by posting bugs on this plugins dev.bukkit page!

This is a bukkit plugin that allows you to add custom actions to buttons in minecraft.

ButtonsPlus uses Vault, so whatever economy plugin you use, will be supported :D

The aim of this plugin is to enable players/Admins on servers to create custom scripted buttons that can do anything from charging you for your own death, to letting you teleport to spawn.

h2. Some Usage Examples:

|Charge for a mob spawn in your mob grinder|
|Charge for a global message to the community|
|Charge for a dispenser to dispense a map of your city|
|Have 3 buttons next to eachother in a maze, and have one teleport the player and the other 2 kill the player or tp them somewhere else(this makes for a reallly long maze X.x|
|Charge for a teleport to a distant land|
|1 press can = 100 actions, so you could custom script a dungeon where when you press a button, you spawn a ton of zombies and tp to an arena :D|
|You can make a player preform a command(that they have perms for) with an action! so, you could create a /back button wherever you spawn, so you do't have to type a command!|
|There are ENDLESS posibilities with ButtonsPlus!|

h2. Note: The permission nodes in this table are for adding the actions only, for allowing a player to complete the action you need to give that group or player the permission node of the action + .push at the end Ex. *buttonsplus.text.push*

|_.Action|_.Description|_.Permission Node|_.Version Added|
|Charge| Charges A player Money For A Button to activate redstone or activate an action(s).|*buttonsplus.charge*|Beta[v1.0]|
|Command| Makes a player preform a command only if the player has access to that command normally, so if bob has perm for /back, but not /ban, then he will be able to use a /back button EVEN IF it has /ban in it, but /ban won't mean anything to bob, cause bob does not have permission for /ban.|*buttonsplus.command*|Beta[v1.0]|
|Text| Displays text to the player that presses the button, you can use colors by inserting the (&) character and the corresponding "minecraft color code":http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Classic_server_protocol#Color_Codes|*buttonsplus.text*|Beta[v1.0]|
|Death| Kills the player that presses the button >:3|*buttonsplus.death*|Beta[v1.0]|
|Teleport| Teleports the player that pressed the button to any spot in any world that the button creator chooses.|*buttonsplus.teleport*|Beta[v1.0]|

|Gmessage(Global Message)| Casts a message to the entire Server, Can include colors just like the text action, but can also display the players name who pressed the button by adding &p for playername, and the creator can also add in &m which will display how much money the player who pressed the button has.|*buttonsplus.globalmessage*|Beta[v1.0]|
|Heal| Heals all health of the player that presses the button.|*buttonsplus.heal*|Beta[v1.0]|

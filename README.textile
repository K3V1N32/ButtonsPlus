h1. About:

This plugin is in a Beta phase meaning there are still some bugs i need to work out, so please help get rid of any bugs in this plugin by posting bugs on this plugins dev.bukkit page!

This is a bukkit plugin that allows you to add custom actions to buttons in minecraft.

ButtonsPlus uses Vault, so whatever economy plugin you use, will be supported :D

The aim of this plugin is to enable players/Admins on servers to create custom scripted buttons that can do anything from charging you for your own death, to letting you teleport to spawn.

h2. Some Usage Examples:

|Charge for a mob spawn in your mob grinder|
|Charge for a global message to the community|
|Charge for a dispenser to dispense a map of your city|
|Have 3 buttons next to eachother in a maze, and have one teleport the player and the other 2 kill the player or tp them somewhere else(this makes for a reallly long maze X.x|
|Charge for a teleport to a distant land|
|1 press can = 100 actions, so you could custom script a dungeon where when you press a button, you spawn a ton of zombies and tp to an arena :D|
|You can make a player preform a command(that they have perms for) with an action! so, you could create a /back button wherever you spawn, so you do't have to type a command!|
|There are ENDLESS posibilities with ButtonsPlus!|

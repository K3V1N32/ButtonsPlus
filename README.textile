h1. ButtonsPlus!

<hr/>

h2. "Download CB1.2.5R1_Beta[v1.0]":https://github.com/downloads/K3V1N32/ButtonsPlus/ButtonsPlus.jar

<hr/>

In order for this plugin to work on your server, you must install "Vault":http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/vault/

And an "Economy Plugin":http://dev.bukkit.org (Search for economy) Or use "iConomy":http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/iconomy/

And you will need some sort of permissions plugin for this to work, goto the Vault dev.bukkit page (Link above) to see the list of compatible permissions plugins for vault!

h1. About:

This plugin is in a Beta phase meaning there are still *alot of bugs* i need to work out, so please help get rid of any bugs in this plugin by posting error reports with the ACTUAL error on this plugins dev.bukkit page!

Please do not ask me ANYTHING if you have not read through this entire README file, I will not answer stupid questions!

This is a bukkit plugin that allows you to add an infinite amount of custom actions to a button in minecraft.

There is currently a 'cooldown' period where players can only press one buttonplus button per 5 seconds. I will be adding a config and cooldown permission very soon.

ButtonsPlus uses Vault, so whatever permissions and economy plugin you use, will be supported :D

The aim of this plugin is to enable players on servers to create custom scripted buttons that can do anything from charging you for your own death, to letting you teleport to spawn.



h2. Some Usage Examples:

|Charge for a mob spawn in your mob grinder|
|Charge for a global message|
|Charge for a dispenser to dispense a map of your city|
|Charge for Nothing at all and be a complete troll|
|Have 3 buttons next to eachother in a maze, and have one teleport the player and the other 2 kill the player or tp them somewhere else(this makes for a reallly long maze X.x|
|Charge for a teleport to a distant land|
|1 press can = 100 actions, so you could custom script a dungeon where when you press a button, you spawn a ton of zombies and tp to an arena :D|
|You can make a player preform a command(that they have perms for) with an action! so, you could create a /back button wherever you spawn, so you do't have to type a command!|
|There are ENDLESS posibilities with buttons plus!|

h3. I will most likely start a forum thread where you can post your awesome ideas/plans for awesome buttons and suggest new actions even!

h1. Actions Explained:

h3. Reference Colors:

h2. Note: The permission nodes in this table are for adding the actions only, for allowing a player to complete the action you need to give that group or player the permission node of the action + .push at the end Ex. *buttonsplus.text.push*

|_.Action|_.Description|_.Permission Node|_.Version Added|
|Charge| Charges A player Money For A Button to activate redstone or activate an action(s).|*buttonsplus.charge*|Beta[v1.0]|
|Command| Makes a player preform a command only if the player has access to that command normally, so if bob has perm for /back, but not /ban, then he will be able to use a /back button EVEN IF it has /ban in it, but /ban won't mean anything to bob, cause bob does not have permission for /ban.|*buttonsplus.command*|Beta[v1.0]|
|Tutorial| The Most Pointless Action Ever Made.(Its exactly the same as text)|*buttonsplus.tutorial*|Beta[v1.0]|
|Text| Displays text to the player that presses the button, you can use colors by inserting the (&) character and the corresponding "minecraft color code":http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Classic_server_protocol#Color_Codes|*buttonsplus.text*|Beta[v1.0]|

|Mob| Spawns a mob in any location that the creator of the button wants.|*buttonsplus.mob*|Beta[v1.0]|
|Gmessage(Global Message)| Casts a message to the entire Server, Can include colors just like the text action, but can also display the players name who pressed the button by adding &p for playername, and the creator can also add in &m which will display how much money the player who pressed the button has.|*buttonsplus.globalmessage*|Beta[v1.0]|
